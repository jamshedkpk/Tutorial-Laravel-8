AJAX is the way to communicate between client and server without page refresh. It is the technique to pass the data from one server to another server without having any interruption.

The full form of AJAX is Asynchronous Javascript and XML. In the regular form, we define the post route in action but, in this case, we describe the action in Javascript and let javascript code handle the rest.
