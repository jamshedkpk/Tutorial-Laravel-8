Component: Component is a peice of code which we can reuse it on the same page as well as on the other page. It is similer to functions. For e.g. if we want to use a header for all pages than instead for all pages we create only one header component and use it on everywhere. Similerly if we want to make a sign up form than we make its component and we use it everywhere. Components are used everywhere we want to use same functionality again and again
